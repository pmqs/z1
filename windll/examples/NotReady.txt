NotReady.txt

The file NotReady.zip is an archive containing works in progress as well
as old example projects that are expected to be dropped.  We recommend
you do not use any of the examples in the NotReady.zip archive.

In particular, the C# example needs work and we hope to have a working
C# example in the main Zip source tree by the next beta/release.
