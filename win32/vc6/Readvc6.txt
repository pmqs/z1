This project builds Zip using Visual Studio 6.  Inclusion of additional
compression methods (bzip2, LZMA, and PPMd) and AES encryption is
now controlled by control.h.  See the comments in there.  In particular,
to include AES encryption the Info-ZIP AES kit must be installed
and AES enabled in control.h.  See INSTALL for more information.
