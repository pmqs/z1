DESCRIPTION
       zipnote writes the comments in  a  zipfile  to  stdout.   This  is  the
       default  mode.  A second mode allows updating the comments in a zipfile
       as well as allows changing the names  of  the  files  in  the  zipfile.
       These modes are described below.

EXAMPLES
       To write all comments in a zipfile to stdout use for example

            zipnote foo.zip > foo.tmp

       This  writes all comments in the zipfile foo.zip to the file foo.tmp in
       a specific format.

       If desired, this file can then be edited to  change  the  comments  and
       then used to update the zipfile.

            zipnote -w foo.zip < foo.tmp

       The  names of the files in the zipfile can also be changed in this way.
       This is done by following lines like
            "@ name"
       in the created temporary file (called foo.tmp here) with lines like
            "@=newname"
       and then using the -w option as above.

BUGS
       The temporary file format is rather  specific  and  zipnote  is  rather
       picky  about it.  It should be easier to change file names in a script.

       Does not yet support writing large (> 2 GB) or split archives.

       UTF-8 paths are not yet fully supported.
