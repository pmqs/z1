Zip 3.1e Announcement DRAFT

We have posted Zip Beta 3.1e, 30 June 2018.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a beta release, but also a Zip 3.1 release candidate.  Zip 3.1e
implements the full feature set planned for release Zip 3.1.  Please
review the feature set for completeness and ease of use as well as look
for any bugs we may have missed.  Another release candidate will be
posted only if needed to address found issues.

Please read the documentation and then try it out.  We suggest starting
with README, essentially the release notes for Zip 3.1e.  Then take a
look at WHATSNEW, a detailed list of what's new in Zip 3.1e, including
feature changes and additions as well as key bug fixes.  Then look over
INSTALL if you will be installing Zip 3.1e.  Finally, scan through the
extended help (zip -hh).  Then try it out, referring to the manual
(zip.1, and the plain text version docs/zip.txt) as needed.
