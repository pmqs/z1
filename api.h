/* api.h and api.c are a callable interface to Zip.  The following entry points
   are defined:

   Exported DLL entry points:

     Current entry points:

       ZpVersion            - Returns version of DLL or LIB.  User should call
                              this first to make sure the found DLL or the LIB
                              used is compatible with your application.

       ZpZip                - Single call main entry point for calling Zip with
                              command line to execute.  This interface takes a
                              command line string, which is parsed.  This and
                              ZpZipArgs are now the only recommended ways to
                              call Zip as a DLL or LIB.

       ZpZipArgs            - Same as ZpZip, but takes an argv[] array of args
                              and an argc argument count instead of a combined
                              command line string.  Args are the same as would
                              be passed to Zip on the command line.  This and
                              ZpZip are now the only recommended ways to call
                              Zip as a DLL or LIB.

       ZpStringCopy         - A simple string copy function used only by the
                              Visual Studio 2010 Visual Basic example in the
                              vb10 directory to pass back string arguments.
                              See that example for how it is used.

     Deprecated (do not use):

       ZpInit               - Initializes function callbacks.  This is now done
                              by providing the callback pointer structure to
                              ZpZip or ZpZipArgs.  This call is flawed when
                              used with the DLL as it sets values that may be
                              overridden before ZpArchive is called to actually
                              perform the work.  If there is interest in this
                              API entry point, let us know.

       ZpArchive            - Calls DLL or LIB using the old options structure.
                              The options structure is now deprecated as much
                              more functionality is provided by using the
                              command line interfaces of ZpZip and ZpZipArgs.
                              Typically this is used by first calling ZpInit to
                              set up the callbacks, but those addresses can get
                              modified or lost before ZpArchive is called,
                              which is one reason it's deprecated.  The options
                              structure has not been updated and ZpArchive has
                              not been recently tested.

     Test entry points:

       ZpZipTest            - Single call main entry point for testing Zip DLL
                              interfaces.  See the vb10 example for how this
                              is used.

       ZpTestComParse       - Test command line parsing, as used by ZpZip.
                              See the vb10 example for how this is used.

       ZpTestCallback       - Test calling a user callback.  See the vb10
                              example for how this is used.

       ZpTestCallbackStruct - Test providing callback addresses to the DLL
                              using the callback structure.  See the vb10
                              example for how this is used.

       ZpCalcCrc32          - Calculates the CRC32 checksum for a buffer.
       
   Calling zipmain directly is now deprecated.  The preferred invocation when
   using the LIB or DLL is via ZpZip (or ZpZipArgs).  When the Zip source is
   included directly, USE_ZIPMAIN_NO_API may be useful, but the API callbacks
   would not be available without code modification.

   Currently the LIB has the following versions:

      zip32_lib.lib       - The Zip static library on Windows.
      zip32_libd.lib      - Debug version of zip32_lib.lib.
      libizzip.a          - The Zip static library on Unix.  This library may
                            be buildable and so available on other ports.  We
                            are looking to add support for .so dynamic
                            libraries in the future.

   Currently the DLL has the following components:

      zip32_dll.dll       - The Zip dynamic library on Windows.
      zip32_dll.lib       - Library to link to with linkages to zip32_dll.dll.
      zip64_dll.dll       - 64-bit version.
      zip64_dll.lib       - 64-bit version.

   We are looking to add .NET support shortly.  This will likely only be
   available using VS 2015 or later.

   In brief, a user program using the DLL calls ZpVersion() to get the version
   of the DLL.  If the version is compatible, ZpZip() is then called to both
   set callbacks and to pass the command line to execute.  (Alternatively,
   ZpZipArgs is used and the individual command line args passed in.  Be
   careful to break the command line into arguments that Zip can process.)
   Because of a need to maintain DLL calling context, best to pass all
   information in a single call to the DLL, which is what ZpZip() and ZpZipArgs
   do.  The old approach of setting callbacks using ZpInit() and then calling
   ZpArchive() to perform the actual archiving operations should no longer be
   used for the DLL as it could result in corrupted data or the app crashing on
   some platforms.  (One should not assume the context of the DLL has not
   changed between the ZpInit() and the ZpArchive() calls.  It probably hasn't,
   but it's still an assumption.  Older Windows platforms has known issues with
   this.)  All interactions with the DLL once ZpZip() is called is through
   callbacks and the final return value.

   When the LIB is linked in, many of the DLL context issues do not apply.  In
   this case ZpInit() could be used to set function callbacks once and the
   local function zipmain() used to actually call Zip.  And, unlike the DLL,
   the LIB inherits the caller's stdin, stdout, and stderr.  The LIB also
   inherits any directory context.  However, using ZpZip() or ZpZipArgs is
   still recommended.

   See WhatsNew_DLL_LIB.txt for related information on the LIB and DLL.

   The following callback functions can be defined by the caller.  Any
   callback not used should be set to NULL.  Zip will skip any NULL
   address callbacks:

     DLLPRNT             - Called to print strings.  Nearly all standard
     (print)               output of Zip is routed through this callback.
                           If set to NULL, standard output is discarded,
                           except for specific output also routed through
                           other callbacks below.  Until you are comfortable
                           using the API, you may want to use this to see
                           what's happening.

     DLLPASSWORD         - If a password is needed by Zip, this function is
     (password)            called.  If the user will be encrypting entries,
                           this callback must be defined to set the password
                           or an error will occur.  Note that this is only
                           called if Zip needs to prompt for a password.

     DLLSERVICE          - If defined, called after each entry is processed.
     (service)             This callback provides stats about the archiving
                           of each file/entry, including compression stats.
                           It also allows the Zip operation to be aborted by
                           setting the callback return code to 1.  (Aborting
                           the operation using this callback can only be
                           done after the current entry has finished
                           processing.  A very large entry could delay this
                           for quite some time.  DLLPROGRESS can provide a
                           finer level of control.)  This version uses long
                           long (64-bit) parameters for file sizes (except
                           on VMS).

     DLLSERVICE_NO_INT64 - A version of DLLSERVICE that does not use 64-bit
     (service_no_int64)    args for file size, but instead uses high and low
                           32-bit parts.  This was needed for Visual Basic 6,
                           for instance, which doesn't know how to handle
                           64-bit arguments.  However, the latest example code
                           in the vb6 directory shows that Visual Studio 6
                           Visual Basic can work with 64-bit parameters.  As
                           such, this callback is now only available on WIN32
                           and is deprecated.

     DLLSPLIT            - Called to request split destination if splitting.
     (split)               THIS IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.  DO NOT USE the split
                           destination feature or split pause feature (-sp)
                           with the DLL until this is implemented.  (-sp is,
                           in fact, locked out when Zip is compiled as a LIB
                           or DLL.)  Note that -s does not interact with the
                           user and can be used by the LIB/DLL to create
                           split archives where all the splits go to the same
                           place.  This callback would only be needed to send
                           some splits to different locations, such as to
                           multiple removable media.

     DLLECOMMENT         - Called to request a comment for an entry.  If the
     (ecomment)            caller will be working with entry comments (-c) this
                           callback must be defined or an error will result.

     DLLACOMMENT         - Called to request the archive zipfile comment.  If
     (acomment)            the caller will be working with archive comments
                           (-z) this callback must be defined or an error will
                           result.  Note that -z now allows specifying a short
                           (one line) archive comment using the form zip:
                             -z="some comment"
                           which does not use the DLLACOMMENT callback.

     DLLPROGRESS         - If defined, this callback is called to report
     (progress)            progress during the Zip operation.  It returns:
                           - entry name (path)
                           - UTF-8 entry name (upath)
                           - % of bytes of entry processed
                           - % of all bytes processed
                           - uncompressed file size in bytes
                           - uncompressed file size as string (such as 7.7m)
                           - action being performed for this entry, such as Add
                           - method being used for this entry, such as Deflate
                           - additional information if any

                           This callback is called at start and end of each
                           entry processing as well as after so many bytes
                           processed for that entry.  The processing chunk
                           size is set as an argument to ZpZip()/ZpZipArgs(),
                           which sets the global progress_chunk_size.  (If
                           ZpArchive is used, or zipmain called directly, and
                           this callback is used, the user must ensure that
                           this global is properly set.)  This is the number
                           of bytes to process before putting out another
                           progress report.  The chunk size should be at least
                           1K bytes.  The smaller the chunk size, the more fine
                           the control and reporting, but the slower the
                           execution (as callbacks take time).  100m (100 MiB)
                           may be a good compromise.  Setting the return code
                           to 1 aborts the zip operation.  Since the progress
                           callback may be called many times while an entry is
                           processed, while the service callback is called
                           just once, using this callback generally allows
                           much quicker response when aborting a large file
                           entry.

     DLLERROR            - This callback is called when a Zip warning or error
     (error)               is generated.  The user should define either the
                           DLLPRNT (print) or DLLERROR (error) callback to see
                           any warnings or errors generated by Zip.  This
                           callback is provided so that DLLPRNT can be NULL
                           (ignore any normal Zip output) while still getting
                           any generated warnings and errors.

     DLLFINISH           - If defined, this callback is called at end of the
     (finish)              zip operation to provide stats for the entire
                           operation.

   Unused callbacks should be set to NULL.  Zip will skip any callbacks where
   the address is set to NULL, though using some features (such as -c or -z)
   without setting the appropriate callback will generate an error.

   As a minimum, the DLLPRNT call back should be defined to see what's going
   on.  Alternatively, the DLLSERVICE and DLLERROR callbacks could be used to
   track progress and handle any warnings or errors.  If passwords or comments
   are being worked with, those callbacks must be defined to provide the
   passwords or comments.

   The ZPOPT structure was used to pass settings, such as root directory, to
   Zip via the ZpArchive() call.  As ZpArchive() is now obsolete, this
   structure should no longer be used and is no longer being updated.  Both
   DLL and LIB users should only use ZpZip() or ZpZipArgs().

   The LIB is now supported on Unix, VMS, and Windows.  The DLL is currently
   only supported on Windows platforms. */

/* There are basically three ways to include Zip functionality:

     DLL     - Compile Zip as a Dynamic Load Library (DLL) and call it from
               the application using DLL conventions.

     LIB     - Compile Zip as a Static Load Library (LIB), link it in, and
               call it from the application.

     in line - Include the Zip source in the application directly and call Zip
               via zipmain (the user will need to handle any reentry issues,
               as well as functions normally handled by callbacks).

   At this point we are mainly only supporting the DLL and LIB approaches.  If
   the user is integrating Zip source directly, they need to work out any
   issues between their code and ours.

   The following macros determine how this interface is compiled:

     WINDLL               - Compile a WIN32 DLL, mainly for Microsoft Visual
                            Studio.  Implies WIN32 and ZIPDLL.  Set by the
                            build environment.  This is also set when building
                            a Windows LIB (along with ZIPLIB).

     WIN32                - Running on WIN32.  The compiler usually sets this.

     ZIPDLL               - Compile the Zip DLL (WINDLL implies this).  Set by
                            the build environment.  (We tend to set WINDLL in
                            our Visual Studio projects for historical reasons.)
                            We currently do not support building dynamic
                            libraries on platforms other than Windows, and as
                            we tend to use WINDLL on Windows, ZIPDLL probably
                            should not be used in any build environment.  It
                            gets set automatically when WINDLL is set.

     WIN32 and ZIPDLL     - This would be used to build a Windows DLL using
                            other than Visual Studio.  However, currently no
                            other Windows platforms are supported for building
                            the DLL.  (OS2 may again be supported some day.)

     USE_ZIPMAIN          - Use zipmain() instead of main().  Set automatically
                            when ZIPDLL or ZIPLIB are set, but could also be
                            used to compile Zip source into another application
                            directly.

     ZIPLIB               - Compile as static library (LIB).  For Microsoft
                            Visual Studio, WINDLL and ZIPLIB are both defined
                            to create the LIB.

     ZIP_DLL_LIB          - Set by zip.h when either ZIPDLL or ZIPLIB are
                            defined.

     NO_ZPARCHIVE         - Deprecated.  Set if not using ZpArchive.  It was
                            used with ZIPLIB on some ports.  (The DLL has to
                            be called from an established entry point so can't
                            be called from zipmain() directly.)  ZpZip is now
                            preferred over calling zipmain() directly.
                            NO_ZPARCHIVE is NOT set when using ZpZip or
                            ZpZipArgs, just call them directly.

     UNIXLIB              - Set when UNIX and ZIPLIB are set.

   On Windows, the build environment should also define _LIB for the static
   library and _USRDLL for the dynamic library.  If you choose the right
   project settings in Visual Studio, these should be set for you.

   When building applications using the LIB, set ZIPLIB in the build environment
   and include api.h.  When building DLL applications, define WINDLL (on Windows)
   or ZIPDLL in the build environment.

   DLL_ZIPAPI is deprecated.  Use of USE_ZIPMAIN && DLL_ZIPAPI for UNIX and VMS
   is replaced by ZIPLIB && NO_ZPARCHIVE.  Creates LIB that calls zipmain()
   directly.  But actually this is now deprecated as well.  The preference now
   is to define ZIPLIB and use ZpZip() or ZpZipArgs().

   File size in the calls below is of type API_FILESIZE_T, which defaults in
   zip.h to uzoff_t.  On Windows (the only port providing a DLL currently) this
   MUST be 64-bit, i.e. the DLL will not run (due to a check in zip.c) if
   compiled without LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT.  The DLL interface sizes are not
   checked, so it is important that only one size be used for each structure
   member, including file size.  LIB users should use API_FILESIZE_T for file
   sizes, which should be set appropriately for the port.  A port can override
   the setting of API_FILESIZE_T in tailor.h or osdep.h.
