Zip 3.1e is a BETA.  Do not distribute.

Zip 3.1 is the latest update of Zip 3.x with large file and split archive
support.  For now Zip 2.3x (Zip 2.32 being the current 2.x release)
remains available and supported, but users should switch to Zip 3.x as soon
as possible as the Zip 2.3x code thread is getting out of touch with modern
systems.

Testing for Zip 3.x so far has focused mainly on Unix, VMS, Mac OS X, and
Windows, so it's likely some ports may not be fully supported.  If you find
your favorite port is partially or completely broken, send us the details,
or, better, send bug fixes.  It's possible that unsupported ports may be
dropped in the future.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zip 3.1e is considered a Release Candidate.  The feature set is relatively
complete and the code is more or less stable.  Except for minor updates and
bug fixes, what's in Zip 3.1e will likely be released as Zip 3.1.  This may
be your last chance to review Zip 3.1 before release and provide comments
and suggestions, and to identify bugs and provide fixes (if you have them).

Overview:

Zip 3.1 is a compression and file packaging utility.  It is compatible with
PKZIP 2.04g (Phil Katz ZIP) for MSDOS systems.  There is a companion to Zip
called UnZip (of course) which you should be able to find in the same place
you got Zip.  Zip and UnZip should be available online at:

   http://www.info-zip.org/
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/infozip/

So far Zip has been ported to a wide array of Unix and other mainframes,
minis, and micros including VMS, OS/2, Minix, MSDOS, Windows, Atari, Amiga,
BeOS and VM/CMS.  Although highly compatible with PKware's PKZIP and
PKUNZIP utilities of MSDOS fame, our primary objective has been one of
portability and other-than-MSDOS functionality.  Features not found in the
PKWare version include creation of zip files in a pipe or on a device; VMS,
BeOS and OS/2 extended file attributes; conversion from Unix to MSDOS text
file format; and, of course, the ability to run on most of your favorite
operating systems.  And it's free.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zip 3.1e Highlights:

(zip31e.ann is an expanded version of this list.  See WHATSNEW for the
detailed list and more on each item.)

- AES encryption included in base Zip source kit, making export controlled.
- New option -p0 (--print0) accepts output of "find -print0".
- Better handling of Zip environment variables.
- Updated API (LIB/DLL) examples include Progress, Error, and Finish.
- Free BSD Unicode fixes.
- VMS AES updates, Adjust fix, CLI updates, filesize fix.
- New --stdinout-tty option for CYGWIN.
- Unicode options refactored to -UD, -UE, -UL, -US, and -UN.
- -SI (--rename-stdin).
- Can specify entry and archive comments on command line or in a file.
- Better Windows Unicode support, including comments.
- Ben Rubson performance updates.
- Unix FTS fast directory sorting.
- Various bug fixes.
- Various compiler fixes.
- NO_BUILD_DATE compile option.  This removes changing build date from the -v
    page that was messing with automated regression tests.

See the extended help (zip -hh) and the manuals (man pages in /man or plain
text versions in docs/) for more on how to use these and other new features.

Note on 16-bit OS support:  Though Zip 3.1 is designed to support the
latest zip standards and modern OS, some effort has been made to maintain
support for older and smaller systems.  If you find Zip 3.1 does not fit on
or otherwise does not work well on a particular OS, send in the details and
we might be able to help.

Copyright Notice:

This source kit includes software from various sources.  Software placed in
the public domain remains in the public domain.  Software from third party
sources (such as bzip2 and AES code) are subject to the licensing noted in
and with those files.  We believe the licenses governing the included files
are compatible with the Info-ZIP license in that meeting the conditions of
the Info-ZIP license should also meet the conditions of the included third-
party files, as long as the notification requirements of those packages are
met.  All other contents of this kit are subject to and distributed under

Additional Notes:

Installation.  Please read the file INSTALL for information on how to
compile and install Zip, ZipSplit, ZipCloak, and ZipNote.  Read the manual
pages (in man format in the man/ directory or in plain text format in the
docs/ directory) for information on how to use them.  INSTALL also includes
installation notes, such as for the PPMd compression issue on AIX/PowerPC
and HP-UX/PA-RISC systems.

Utilities.  At this point ZipSplit, ZipCloak, and ZipNote should work
with large files (larger than 4 GiB) if LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT is enabled.
ZipSplit and ZipNote now can read split (multi-disk) archives, though they
can't output splits.  ZipCloak does not handle split input archives due
to limitations of the zcrypt software.  (We hope to resolve these issues
before Zip 3.1 is released.)

Bug reports.  Our primary method for receiving bug reports is via the web
form at http://info-zip.org/zip-bug.html (on SourceForge this is at
http://infozip.sourceforge.net/zip-bug.html) and suggestions for new
features can be submitted there (although we don't promise to use all of
them).  (We have discontinued the old email address zip-bugs@lists.wku.edu
because of too much spam.)  Previously we also recommended checking out
the Info-ZIP discussion forum, but it recently suffered a catastrophic
failure and may not be coming back.

Ports to other OS/compilers.  If you're considering a port to a new system
or compiler, please check in with zip-bugs FIRST, since the code is
constantly being updated behind the scenes.  We'll arrange to give you
access to the latest source.

Discussion forum.  The discussion forum previously at
http://www.info-zip.org/phpBB3/index.php suffered a fatal failure that may
not be recoverable.  The various Info-ZIP mailing-lists on
mxserver@lists.wku.edu have not been available for some time and the temporary
QuickTopic discussion group for Info-ZIP issues at
http://www.quicktopic.com/27/H/V6ZQZ54uKNL died a horrible death due to
large amounts of spam.  (The old QuickTopic discussion group remains available,
but read only.)  We want to thank all of you who contributed to Zip and UnZip
through the forum.  We are looking into possible replacements.  For now,
we can be reached by email (via the web form) and through the discussion
threads on SourceForge.

Frequently Asked Questions on Zip and UnZip:

(See the FAQ page on our website (http://www.info-zip.org/FAQ.html) for
more information.)

Q. When unzipping I get an error message about "compression method 8".

A. This is standard deflate, which has been around for awhile.  Please
   get a current version of UnZip.


Q. How about "compression method 12"?  What methods are out there?

A. Compression method 12 is bzip2 and requires a relatively modern UnZip.
   Please get the latest version of UnZip.

   Here are some of the compression methods out there (* = Zip 3.1 has):

   *  0    Store
   *  8    Deflate
      9    Enhanced Deflate (UnZip has; may get added to Zip soon)
   * 12    bzip2
   * 14    LZMA
     19    IBM LZ77 z Architecture (PFS)
     95    XZ (may get added to Zip soon)
     96    Jpeg
     97    WavPack
   * 98    PPMd (version I, Rev 1)

    Use of anything other than Store or Deflate requires a relatively
    current unzip.  UnZip 6.00 can read bzip2.  UnZip 6.1 will read
    entries compressed with LZMA and PPMd.

    The next release of Zip will likely include additional methods, such
    as XZ.


Q. What encryption does Zip support?  UnZip?

A. Zip 3.1 supports Traditional zip (ZipCrypto) encryption as well as AES
   encryption.  (Zip 3.0 and before only supported Traditional encryption.)

   Traditional zip encryption is the encryption that has been supported by
   Zip since early on.  It is widely supported, but is considered weak by
   today's standards and is relatively easy to crack.  Zip now includes
   Traditional encryption in the base source kit (this kit).  It can be
   disabled (see INSTALL for details), but we no longer ship a kit that is
   encryption free.

   Zip 3.1 now supports AES encryption.  Our AES implementation is now
   included in the standard distribution, but be aware it is subject to US
   Export Control laws making the standard Zip distribution export controlled.
   Our AES implementation is based on WinZip AES (which is based on Gladman's
   implementation of AES) and is compatible with WinZip, 7-Zip and other
   utilities out there.  Zip supports 128-, 192- and 256-bit encryption.
   AES strong encryption can be disabled.  See INSTALL for more details.

   UnZip 5.x and UnZip 6.0 support Traditional encryption.  UnZip 6.1 will
   support Traditional and AES encryption.


Q. I can't extract this zip file that I just downloaded.  I get
   "zipfile is part of multi-disk archive" or some other message.

A. Please make sure that you made the transfer in binary mode.  Check
   in particular that your copy has exactly the same size as the original.
   Note that the above message also may actually mean you have only part
   of a multi-part archive.  Also note that UnZip 5.x and UnZip 6.0
   don't have multi-disk (split) archive support.  A work around
   is to use Zip 3.0 or later to convert the split archive to a single-file
   archive, then use UnZip on that archive.  Another is to use ZipSplit to
   convert the split archive to a set of smaller archives that UnZip can
   process as a set.  The latest UnZip 6.1 beta can read split archives.

   If the archive is actually broke or missing splits, try zip -F to put
   what you have into a new archive.  If you're missing the last disk,
   you may have to use zip -FF.


Q. When running UnZip, I get a message about "End-of-central-directory
   signature not found".

A. This usually means that your zip archive is damaged, or that you
   have an uncompressed file with the same name in the same directory.
   In the first case, it makes more sense to contact the person you
   obtained the zip file from rather than the Info-ZIP software
   developers, and make sure that your copy is strictly identical to
   the original.  In the second case, use "unzip zipfile.zip" instead
   of "unzip zipfile", to let UnZip know which file is the zip archive
   you want to extract.

   If the archive is actually missing the end, try zip -FF to fix it,
   but note that zip -FF can't restore files that are in the missing
   part of the archive.


Q. Why doesn't Zip do <something> just like PKZIP does?

A. Zip is not a PKZIP clone and is not intended to be one.  In some
   cases we feel PKZIP does not do the right thing (e.g., not
   including pathnames by default); in some cases the operating system
   itself is responsible (e.g., under Unix it is the shell which
   expands wildcards, not Zip).  (The shell remains the default on Unix,
   but Zip 3.1 now expands quoted or escaped wildcards.)  Info-ZIP's and
   PKWARE's zipfiles are interchangeable, not the programs.

   For example, if you are used to the following PKZIP command:
               pkzip -rP foo *.c
   you must use instead on Unix:
               zip -R foo "*.c"
   (The "*.c" is a pattern Zip will use to match paths to.  The quotes
   are needed to let the shell know that it should not expand the *.c
   argument but instead pass it on to the program, but are not needed
   on ports that do not expand file paths like MSDOS.)


Q. Can I distribute Zip and UnZip sources and/or executables?

A. You may redistribute the latest official distributions without any
   modification, without even asking us for permission. You can charge
   for the cost of the media (CDROM, diskettes, etc...) and a small copying
   fee.  If you want to distribute modified versions please contact us at
   www.Info-ZIP.org first. You must not distribute beta versions.  A
   partial exception are betas designated by Info-ZIP as "public betas."
   Public betas should not be distributed as well, as all features may not
   be fully implemented and full testing may not have been done, but it's
   understood that public betas may include features immediately useful to
   some users and so distribution is not recommended but not prohibited.
   The latest official distributions are always on ftp.Info-ZIP.org in
   directory /pub/infozip and subdirectories and at SourceForge.  All
   source and binary distributions are subject to the conditions in the
   Info-ZIP license.  See the Info-ZIP license for details.


Q. Can I use the executables of Zip and UnZip to distribute my software?

A. Yes, so long as it is made clear in the product documentation that
   neither UnZip nor Zip is being sold, that the source code is freely
   available, and that there are no extra or hidden charges resulting
   from its use by or inclusion with the commercial product.  See the
   Info-ZIP license for more.  Here is an example of a suitable notice:

     NOTE:  <Product> is packaged on this CD using Info-ZIP's compression
     utility.  The installation program uses UnZip to read zip files from
     the CD.  Info-ZIP's software (Zip, UnZip and related utilities) is
     freely distributed under the Info-ZIP license and can be obtained as
     source code or executables from various sites, including
     ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip.


Q. Can I use the source code of Zip and UnZip in my commercial application?
   Can I include binary libraries?

A. Yes, as long as the conditions in the Info-ZIP license are met.  For
   example, you could include in your product documentation the required
   acknowledgments and note that the original sources are available at
   www.Info-ZIP.org.  If you have special requirements contact us.
